It's been a while since I last wrote in this blog. Empire has grown massively since then; the server
now supports constructing and upgrading buildings, and resource generation, accumulation and
collection—all backed by a powerful modifier system. I also decided to roll out my own auth. Yes,
"never roll out your own auth", I've heard it before. But how else to learn, other than to
experiment and get my hands dirty? Same reason I tried writing a binary protocol, really.
