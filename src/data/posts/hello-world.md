**Hi, my name is Lucas**

and I'm a Business Informatics graduate, software engineer, and translator. I'm also an avid reader,
I like to play videogames and write code in my free time, and I aspire to be a stoic, or at least
emulate the sage well enough. With this first post, I aim to explain my reasoning for writing a blog
and what its contents will be.

First in the order of business: why am I writing a blog. Simple: I wish to have a chronological
record of my learnings, my work and the evolution of my knowledge over time. My idea was therefore
to write posts about the technologies I'm currently using, the scripts I put together, the neat
tricks I learn and so on. My other reason is to maybe help someone. I know I enjoy reading a
well-put article on using a piece of tech, code etc, and I wish to give back by writing my own
(hopefully) well-written articles.

Regarding the content, you can expect to see posts all over the tech spectrum: frontend frameworks,
server administration, API development, DevOps, containers, CI/CD pipelines, Unix tools, development
environments, hardware, keyboards, audio and maybe more. A somewhat large collection of topics, but
I have a large assortment of interests.

So, this is my personal website. It is intended to be my resumé, portfolio and blog all in one
little bundle. I hope to post something every now and then, and I'm currently working on a projects
gallery to host my portfolio. I am also working on a secret project in Rust...

That will be it for now. I hope to have your eyes again for the next article.
